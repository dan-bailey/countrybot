Look up a list of country names, get translations from an API, and spit out a CSV.

I wrote this to get the translated names of each country and to build a spreadsheet out of them.  It was part of a client project and rather than just do it the one time, I opted to write it as a script so I'd never have to do it again.  Could be modified pretty easily to handle alternate languages.

I also feel an overwhelming need to apologize for the state of this -- writing it in PHP was dumb.  It's what I was best/fastest in at the time.  Today, I'd write this in python.
